## Technologies Used

   git clone https://github.com/7sg56/StopWatch-online.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Project Structure

```

├── index.html    # Main HTML file
├── style.css     # Stylesheet for the application
├── app.js        # JavaScript file for stopwatch logic
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

- **Start Button**: Begins the stopwatch.
- **Stop Button**: Pauses the stopwatch without resetting the time.
- **Reset Button**: Stops the stopwatch and resets the time to `00:00:00`.

The time is calculated and updated dynamically using JavaScript, ensuring smooth transitions and accuracy.
